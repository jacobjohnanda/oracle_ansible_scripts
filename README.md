# ORACLE ANSIBLE SCRIPTS

NetApp® ONTAP® 9.6 and later versions include support for an expansive RESTful web services API. In comparison to an ONTAPI® application,
the REST API offers a vastly simplified and workflow-driven user experience, allowing you to perform multiple operations on the storage
objects with a single API. REST is the industry standard for API development and the ONTAP REST API provides a great opportunity to 
automate your storage deployments.

This repository contains sample scripts illustrating how to use the ONTAP REST API. You can access the API through the Python client 
library, which is preferable in most situations. If needed, you can also connect directly to the API using the native capabilities 
provided with Python. See the repository folder **examples** with two subfolders containing sample code by usage type. Also see the 
folder **lod** for instructions on using the NetApp Lab on Demand (LOD) to run the sample scripts.
